<p> There are many variations of passages of <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> available,
    but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, 
    <em>by injected humour</em>, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
    If you are going to use a passage of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u>,
    you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden
    in the middle of text. <strong>All the Lorem Ipsum</strong>
    generators on the <b>Internet</b> tend to repeat predefined 
    chunks as necessary, making this the first
    true generator on the Internet.
